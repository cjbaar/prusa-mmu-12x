# Prusa MMU Modification for 12 Filaments

## DISCLAIMER

Use at your own risk. I have not necessarily tested each individual file.
If possible, use provided configs to compile your own hex files.

If you are getting the BSOD ("Multile Errors CFSR" message) on the MK4S, upgrading to firmware 6.2.0-RC1 or newer may solve these issues. https://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Firmware-Buddy/releases/tag/v6.2.0-RC1
