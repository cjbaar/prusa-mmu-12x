# Prusa MMU Modification for 12 Filaments

## DISCLAIMER

Use at your own risk. I have not necessarily tested each individual file.
If possible, use provided configs to compile your own hex files.

If you have an MK4S, the firmware needs to be 6.2.0-RC1 or newer or you will get the BSOD. https://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Firmware-Buddy/releases/tag/v6.2.0-RC1
